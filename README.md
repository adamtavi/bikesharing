## Purpose
Purpose of this is to prepare a proposal to endorse having a bike riding share business in Des Moines.
The below bike trip analysis was conducted:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
At the end of the analysis our team comes up with a recommendation on how this business could flourish in this new market. 

## Analysis 
### Checkout times for users

### Results
-	As you can see majority of checkout times largely last around 20minutes looking at the data. This shows that most people don’t checkout a bike longer for a relatively short amount of time throughout a day.

### Checkout times by Gender

### Results
-	The analysis shows that majority of men utilize the bike service more than women and checkout the bike for a longer duration of time. 

### Trips by Weekday by hour

### Results
-	The data shows that during the morning hours before 6-9am work and after work hours 5-6pm are when the bike is utilized the most by customers.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

### Results
-	The data shows that men are mostly are subscribers to the bike share service than being a one-time customer and the same goes with women. It’s good to note that the business flourishes more on subscribers so to see that most of the customers are subscribers it shows that people are dependent on the bikes as means for transportation.

### Bike Utilization

### Results
-	This shows that most bikes used have an even distribution rate with some outliers but none that are extremely glaring.

### Bike Upkeep

### Results
-	This shows bikes utilization counts – the darker region shows higher bike utilization and the lighter region showing lesser bike utilization. This allows us to see that there are more bikes in the lower bike utilization side than the higher utilization side.

## Summary
High-level analysis of the results is that this business seems to work well in NYC and has potential to work very well in Des Moines. It’s important to follow NYC’s strategy of getting more customers as subscribers and provide people a cheaper opportunity for everyday travel. 
One future analysis could be showing where in Des Moines are there people living close to work since the data supports that most people use this service before work and after work hours. Another future analysis could be how much does it cost to maintain a bike to show further break down on potential expenses / maintenances
